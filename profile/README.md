# ASAM Code Platform
![tp header](/doc/img/Asam_Background_1.png)

ASAM e.V. (Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems) is a non-profit organization that promotes standardization of tool chains in automotive development and testing. Our members are international car manufacturers, suppliers, tool vendors, engineering service providers, and research institutes. ASAM standards are developed by experts from our member companies and are based on real use cases. ASAM is the legal owner of these standards and is responsible for their distribution and marketing.

ASAM provides support in connecting members, coordinating work groups, and developing, releasing, and maintaining standards. Our active community includes more than 400 member organizations around the world. These members ensure that ideas with market relevance will progress into standards and that these standards are used worldwide. 

The standards developed at ASAM span a wide range of use cases in automotive development, test, and Validation. They define file formats, data models, protocols, and interfaces. All ASAM standards aim to enable easy exchange of data and tools within and across tool chains. They are applied worldwide.

## ASAM projects

Here are quick-links to the ASAM projects and their repositories.

More information about active projects can be found on our webpage [www.asam.net](https://www.asam.net/active-projects/projects/).

### ASAM quality checker framework

A quality checker framework that allows the configuration, execution and reporting of checks. Checks are based on rules defined by ASAM standards that allow users to validate conformity of files and implementations against ASAM standards.

- [qc-pyFramework]()
- [QC_Opendrive](https://github.com/asam-ev/qc-opendrive)
- [qc-openscenarioxml](https://github.com/asam-ev/qc-openscenarioxml)

### ASAM OSI® (Open Simulation Interface)
ASAM OSI® (Open Simulation Interface) is a specification for interfaces between models and components of a distributed simulation. OSI is strongly focused on the environmental perception of automated driving functions.

- [Documentation](https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/latest/specification/index.html)
- [Class Reference](https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/latest/gen/annotated.html)
- [open-simulation-interface](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface) - The main repository for the standard.
- [osi-sensor-model-packaging](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-sensor-model-packaging) - https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-sensor-model-packaging
- [osi-validation](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-validation) - The OSI Validator checks the compliance of OSI messages with predefined rules.
- [osi-documentation](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-documentation) - Hosts the AsciiDoc-based part of the documentation. It contains generals parts of the content and a CI-pipeline that renders the document with Asciidoctor and deploys it to the gh-pages of this repo.
- [osi-antora-generator](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-antora-generator) - The pipeline of this repository is responsible for creating the combined and versioned Antora output for ASAM OSI. It also pushes it to the respective GitHub pages for hosting.

### ASAM OpenMaterial

There is a growing need to accurately represent the real world in simulation, a so-called digital twin, particularly as the need for physical sensor simulation grows. However, for this to be feasible, physically correct modelling of material properties is fundamental. To ensure consistent testing across platforms and by different stakeholders, 3D models and corresponding material properties need to be unambiguously exchangeable. It is proposed to develop a standardized format for material properties.
